THIS REPOSITORY IS TEMPORARY AND WILL BE MOVED TO THE SECONDHANDS GITHUB.

Before running the PickAndPlaceScenario
(scenarios/PickAndPlaceScenario/startScenario.sh) you will need to run the
Y1DemoSimulationScenario from the SecondHandsY1DemoSimulation package. That's
the simulation scenario with the Y1 scene.

The SecondHandsY1DemoSimulation package repository is:

git@gitlab.tech.lastmile.com:robotics/SecondHandsY1DemoSimulation.git.
